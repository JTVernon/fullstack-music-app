## Fullstack Music App

Under Deployment 

A fullstack music app using NextJS, TypeScript, and seeded databases using Prisma and Heroku.  

This app is set up to use an access token for users to view and stream music in a set of playlists.  A middleware file limits access, so that users without authorization are automatically redirected to a sign up page.
